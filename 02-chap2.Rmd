# Connecting Home Prices to Voting {#motive-opportunity}

>"We're creating...an ownership society in this country, where more Americans than ever will be able to open up their door where they live and say, welcome to my house, welcome to my piece of property."[@klein2008disowned]

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) countered the unfurling crisis with a hodgepodge of policies aimed, variously, at mitigating spillover effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
This aim congrued with the Bush administration's "ownership society", which added moral heft to the legal onus placed on individuals to become solely responsible for their own property.
By mitigating spillover effects, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program would attempt to isolate homes from the "animal spirits"[@keynes2007general] of the surrounding market(s), and focus success or failure of a person's finances on their own actions.
However, despite the ideological congruence between the NSP and Bush's ownership society, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program departed from the Republican Party by privatizing government money for less (or even negatively) affluent people.
In the United States, both Republican and Democratic parties have connected this action with higher taxation, and with the Democratic Party.
So, while the policies fit with the Bush administration, their ideological dimension tended more towards the Democratic Party.

But, as mentioned early in \@ref(actors-motive), opposing the leftward pull of ideology is the rightward push of rising wealth.
Higher levels of wealth and income are colloquially associated with conservatism, but there is little research on the economic mechanisms beyond class that push such people towards their political decisions. THIS IS NOT TRUE
As such, the rightward push of rising wealth was not a given: after World War II, taxation was not a weighty political issue,[@campbell2009how, 160] let alone a wedge issue.
Rather, responses to California's Proposition 13 and reverberations of Reaganite rhetoric led Republicans "to define themselves and their party in opposition to taxes."[@martin2008welcome, 128]
Third Way Democrats, led by President Bill Clinton, accepted tax cuts in their successful political bids---it was only in the 2000s that Democrats on a national level united (more or less) in opposition to lower taxation.

The mortgage crisis hit at a moment in American politics when the two parties agreed that---along with wars in the Middle East---taxation and visible, means-tested welfare were the political issues of the day; the only difference was the moral valence each party attached to the issues.
The connection between taxation, welfare, and party platforms came to a head in the late 2000s.
After the mortgage crisis ushered in a financial crisis and the Great Recession, economic policy adopted a militant vocabulary.
In response, grassroots anti-tax movements (thoroughly astroturfed by conservative non-profits) took up equally rhetorical arms, with CNBC reporter Rick Santelli sounding the battle cry of the Tea Party Movement.

The Tea Party Movement sharpened the debate over taxes.
What had been salient in the decades before the trauma of the financial and mortgage crises re-emerged as the guiding issue of the Republican Party.
The salience of taxation, and the formalization of candidates into members of the Tea Party Caucus, provide a theoretical underpinning to this study.
Without the self-professed and much-discussed focus on taxation during the 2010 midterm elections, analyzing voters' awareness of candidates' tax positions would be required in order to effectively argue that voting behavior ran with tax policies.
The focus on taxation, and the clear connection between expenditures on visible welfare programs and higher taxation, make possible the aggregation of individual tax preferences into party voting.

In this chapter, I dive into how the Neighborhood Stabilization Program fit ideologically with the Bush administration, and the Republican Party between 2008 and 2010.
I argue that the NSP hewed more closely to the ideology of the Democratic Party than of the Republican Party between 2008 and 2010.
Further, the snugness of this fit was not a given, but was contingent on a tax protest movement like that of the Tea Party.
American party politics were crucial to corralling the effects of foreclosure relief programs into legible distinctions for vote analysts.


## The Neighborhood Stabilization Program, Ideologically

Section 2301(a) of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 appropriates $3,920,000,000

>for assistance to States and units of general local government (as such terms are defined in section 102 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5302)) for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed upon homes and residential properties.

Due to the size of the bill passed and the extent of modifications by a range of members, it is unclear who inserted the provision.
However, a select few news sources picked up on the insertion, including a Reuters piece which claimed "The White House had originally opposed a provision that offers $4 billion in grants to states to buy and repair foreclosed homes."[@pelofsky2008bush]
The opposition by the Bush administration of the $4 billion outlay, a mere 1.3% of the \$300 billion ensured to Fannie Mae, indicates that the amender likely belonged to the Democratic Party.
Albeit brief, this opposition---the only opposition mentioned in an article awash in hundred-billion-dollar outlays---is surprising given its size and the power held by the federal government.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administered the funds through its Community Development Block Grant program, a core piece of HUD's community investment apparatus.
By routing the funding through a pre-existing program, the bill's writers sought to leverage established lines of communication between HUD and the several states.
This provision also avoided long-term commitments by HUD to far-flung localities, pushing the purchase and selling of properties to an arms-length.
But, while the bill collected information and decision-making at the local level, its compliance regulations were still onerous.
Dan Immergluck argues in @immergluckPreventingNextMortgage2015 that ensuing language in HERA, which limits localities to purchase properties at a discount from market price, lessened the program's efficacy.
Much like a buyer of used cars, houses at a discount are more likely, *a priori*, to be lemons, since the seller wouldn't take less than market price for an above-average quality home.
Beyond that, federal oversight of localities was intense, as the administration took an extremely risk-averse approach to mismanagement of funds, fitting the image pushed by conservatives in Bush's party of housing programs as loci of graft and inefficiency.

Funds were originally calculated by a need-based formula factoring in rates of foreclosure, subprime borrowing, and payment delinquency in order to address areas "identified by the State or unit of general local government as likely to face a significant rise in the rate of home foreclosures."[@pelosi2008housing]
In doing so, the legislation aimed to use the buying power of the federal government to bid up prices in neighborhoods by taking housing stock off the market (at least temporarily), recording purchase prices close to (but, as per requirement, lower than) market levels, and reselling said housing stock after capital investments (in the form of maintenance and repairs).
The political import of this plan is difficult to understand in the vacuum of it and its party supporters.
At the time, dispossessed homeowners and their coalitions called for principal reductions, a common decision in courts of equity and bankruptcy cases, or immediate relief to homeowners currently in default.
Rather than direct cash transfers, which would have enhanced individual freedom by loosening budget constraints, or pass-through payments to debt holders, which would have promoted rent-seeking by those debt holders, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program advocated for indirect pushes on home equity.

The NSP attempted to cosset homeowners from endogenous shocks, recognizing the social dislocation caused by such a stupid destruction of private wealth.
While some homeowners could be painted as the kind of irresponsible, purely-speculating "deadbeats" characterized in @dayenChainTitleHow2016 and Michael Lewis' *The Big Short*, it is important to remember that the majority of those foreclosed upon were prime borrowers.[@ferreira2015new]
Further, the distress of prime borrowers came somewhat after that of subprime borrowers, as seen in @ref(fig:distress) (though that is partially because there was more "fuel left to burn" in the sense that the number subprime borrowers, around 20% of the market, had already been slashed).
These facts suggest that neighborhoods with prime borrowers contracted the foreclosure contagion from subprime borrowers, which fits in the narrative of responsible, well-to-do homeowners forced into foreclosure by their subprime neighbors.

```{r distress, fig.cap= "Left: Total foreclosures and short sales by owner type. Right: Probability of home loss by owner type.", echo = FALSE, out.width='45s0%', fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(c("figure/ferreira_absolute.png", "figure/ferreira_distress.png"))
```

Protected from the shocks to home prices (and thus home equity), the success or failure of borrowers' real estate investment would then depend purely on their payments.
To maintain the idea of a meritocratic path to the American Dream, from time to time the route must be cleared of such hazards.
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program did not aim, like its administrative superstructure does, to develop communities in any meaningful way.
Rescuing communities from visual blight were incidental effects of the policy and tied only to blight's impact on home prices.
Rather, the NSP aimed at a lower, more foundational goal of saving the plunging home equities of several million individuals.

This individuation, this buffer from the market, is a privilege long conferred upon the American home in law and policy.
The private-public distinction is made much sharper for homeowners than for renters.
Consider for instance 4th Amendment cases, where property law still dominates legal interpretations despite the impact of *Katz v. United States*, which expanded what the 4th Amendment shielded to include more person-centric concepts.[@sternInviolateHomeHousing2010]
Or consider the mortgage interest deduction, a large subsidy applied to owner-occupied properties.
The history of American housing policy---both as centralized legislation and decentralized legal interpretation---has conferred on homeowners (who are by construction also land owners) additional rights when compared to renters, expanding the legal extent of their individual selves.

These privileges made up much of the popular appeal of George W. Bush's "ownership society".
While it lived a larger life in the media than in Bush's own remarks, the philosophy backed up much of Bush's domestic policy.
The definition is almost self-evident: an America where as much is owned and controlled by individuals as is feasible. Bush explained the logic guiding this idea by claiming that "The more ownership there is in America, the more vitality there is in America, and the more people have a vital stake in the future of this country."[@2004fact]
With this claim came a raft of policies demonstrating the promise of an ownership society.
Under this capacious roof, the administration enclosed health savings accounts, more individualized retirement options, and policies aimed at increasing homeownership.
These policies included the American Dream Downpayment Initiative, which tied homeownership explicitly to the American Dream, and the Single-Family Affordable Housing Tax Credit.[@2002homeownership]
By encouraging single-family homes in the "Nation’s inner cities", thinning the density of apartment complexes and tenements, this last provision harkened back to New Deal marketing, which idealized the home as a Romantic "refuge from urban corruption."[@sternInviolateHomeHousing2010, 910]
Bush's ownership society provisions also included a "tripling of funding"[@2002homeownership] for a program that swapped personal or volunteer labor for housing assistance, known in low-income housing development as "sweat equity".
These programs in aggregate, pushed a narrative of meritocratic access to consumer credit spurring individual ownership.
The NSP, in turn, slotted into this story by insulating responsible (*i.e.* those who have not yet defaulted)---if low-income---debtors from the vagaries of wily housing markets.

Such a conformity with Bush's animating philosophy, despite the program's brief opposition by the president, places the Neighborhood Stabilization Program in murky territory with regard to party affiliation.
If voters were unable to locate programs like the NSP within Democratic or Republican platforms, then there would be no reason why pro--home price policies translate into Republican votes.
Bush's ownership society performed an entirely unrevolutionary act by presenting homeownership as a bedrock of ideal (and idyllic) America, as such a message had been pushed by presidents on both sides of the aisle since at least the Great Depression.[@stollerHousingCrashEnd2016]
But while the values cherished by Bush's ownership society aligned with American conservatism, its distinctive policies were afield of the contemporaneous Republican platform.
Instead, the policies looked like a [more] moralistic version of Democratic plans for affordable housing and access to credit.

(NEED FACTS ABOUT THE FOCUS ON TAXATION AND WELFARE)
Republican focus on taxation and opposition to visible, continuing welfare assistance crowded out other domestic policy issues, like the politics of debt that had been so visible to midwest farmers in the 1930s, Massachussetts farmers in the 1780s, and opponents of the Cross of Gold in the late 19th century.
Instead, what talk there was regarding debt were byproducts of a more general concern over asset prices.
This talk proceeded from the expansion of finance's place in the economy and culture of the United States.
While bankers had always been handsomely paid, it was not until the liberalizations of the Reagan era that its ranks swelled in quantity and individual wealth.
These included passage of the Garn--St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982---which Paul Krugman holds responsible for the savings and loan crisis[@krugman2009reagan] for its grant of permission to private lenders for the sale of adjustable-rate mortgages---but I pay particular attention to the exaltation of multinational creditors in mortgage markets.
A year before the Garn--St. Germain Act, Reagan enacted his signature reform, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which allowed troubled savings and loan institutions to sell home mortgages and consequently write down their tax burdens.[@lewis2010fat]
This provision opened the floodgates for private-label mortgage securitization; where savings and loans had dominated the private market, investment banks could now cash in.
By definition, it was these creditors that enabled the expansion of mortgage-backed securities to subprime lenders, and with them, significant economic growth.

Between 1981 and 2007, outstanding residential mortgage debt---shown in \@ref(fig:hhdebt)---swelled from 37% of US gross domestic product to 82%, more than doubling in relative size.[@boardofgovernorsofthefederalreservesystemus1949mortgagea; @boardofgovernorsofthefederalreservesystemus1949mortgageb; @boardofgovernorsofthefederalreservesystemus1949mortgagec; @usbureauofeconomicanalysis1929gross]
On the other side of the largest pool of consumer debt in the world stood an even larger pool of capital.
While the rampant foreign direct investment (FDI) of Japan and Germany are oft noted in economic histories of the 1980s, potentially more significant were the destination of such capital flows.
Herman Schwartz disaggregates the flows of FDI entering and exiting the United States to explain why, despite the large [net] debt position of America, the country was not hamstrung by austerity provisions but actually received net positive income.
His answer is that the consumption-driven American economy leveraged credit made cheap by global disinflation to extend its own resources and drive aggregate demand.[@schwartz2009subprime]
Global disinflation resulted partially from the sheer supply of credit and in turn made the interest rates offered by mortgage-backed securities a viable alternative to dampening rates of return from traditional investments.
This process fueled itself for a while: lower interest rates meant that buyers could afford more expensive homes on the same monthly payments, bidding up the prices of homes; when nearby home prices appreciated, homeowners could refinance, paying off the first mortgage, marginally lowering the risk and thus interest rate for the next mortgagee in the market.
This process played out in every country able to profitably securitize mortgages, but the Reagan administration's reconfiguration of credit ennabled the United States to reap the world's largest benefits---Schwartz estimates that this system accounted for BLANK BLANK percentage of the US' BLANKETY differential growth rate from DATE1 to DATE2.

```{r}
include_graphics("figure/residential_debt_gdp.png")
```

More than good macroeconomic policy, the growth buffered homeowners from wage stagnation or job loss altogether.
In conjunction with liberalized finance, labor norms and regulations that had protected the Fordist labor compact linking 30-year employment with 30-year mortgages were repealed.
While these repeals have wrought huge blows to bargaining power, their perceived impact was aided---and perhaps eclipsed---by the spatial and international movements of manufacturing jobs away from the organized mid-Atlantic and Midwest, to the unorganized American South, and ultimately abroad to the Global South.
In any case, labor markets became increasingly volatile in the United States, necessitating some form of insurance.
Matt Stoller argues that the exaltation of finance, subordination of labor, and mitigation of social insurance policies can be viewed macrosocially as a renegotiation of the American social contract inaugurated by the New Deal.[@stollerHousingCrashEnd2016]
Where businesses had profited on the aggregate demand generated by collectively-bargained salaries and the commensurate long-term commitments by employer and employee, the new asset-backed political economy^[Note too the growth in equity holdings by Americans. In 1962, 1 in 7 households held more than $2,000 in stocks; in 1983, with the growth of IRAs and defined-contribution plans, nearly 1 in 4 households hold more than \$2,000 in stock (1992 dollars).[@poterba1995stock, 321]] discarded with the need for stable, steadily increasing salaries.
These jobs, salaries, and benefits then acted as dragnets on profits, ultimately jettisonned at the behest of shareholders.
In return, the asset-backed social contract offered cheap credit and the Minskyan promise of speculative returns to supplement, or supplant, income.

By locating this process in the Reagan administration, I have obviously extended beyond 1991, which I mentioned in @ref(#actors-motive) as the start of continually-increasing home prices.
I point to somehwere in the late 1990s as an inflection point in the Minsky cycle, pictured in \@ref(fig:minsky), between speculative and Ponzi financing, a point before which housing was foundational to this new "social contract" but not overheated so as to wreak the damage it ultimately wrought.
Despite 1991's brief negative sojourn, this agreement was contingent on rising home prices, and leveraged by Bush the elder as well as Bill Clinton in their presidencies.
Housing, often couched in the language of the American Dream, supported many (WHOSE?) national campaigns.
And, while there were differences between Republican and Democratic housing platforms, what united their approaches was a vocabulary of taxation and credit, not debt.
Despite the rich history of debt politics among American farmers, parties focused on access to loans and reductions to government revenues rather than creditors' profits.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.cap="Minsky cycle, theorized by Hyman Minsky."}
include_graphics("figure/minsky.png")
```

To be sure, this vocabulary was a rational response to the rising home prices---so long as markets showed signs of growth, debt relief would be a minor issue, while tax reductions and access to credit extended individual budgets.
But it was not uniquely rational: dependable debt relief could, if annualized, be indistinguishable from a similary-sized mortgage tax credit; after all, with all the easy credit, there was certainly enough debt to go around---in addition to mortgage debt equalling 82% of gross domestic product, mortgage debt service payments in 2007 increased 75% over 1981 levels.[@boardofgovernorsofthefederalreservesystemus1980mortgage]

To summarize, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program sought to insulate homeowners from the market by using the buying power of the federal government to fix local home prices.
This program, despite the initial opposition of the Bush administration, fit with George W. Bush's "ownership society", which emphasized private, family-owned property as both a social and economic doctrine.
But Bush's ownership society, while conservative, helped established and would-be homeowners manage and mitigate their debt load.
This practice ran contrary to nation-wide Republican platforms, which emphasized a politics of taxation.
It was not that the NSP completely contradicted the Grand Old Party, but rather that policies affecting housing debt (and wealth) were outside the scope of national rhetoric; debt was illegible to Republican voters.
Instead, Republicans cast housing debt---and programs that help homeowners pay down housing debt---as a burden to the tax base.
But why, and how, was a question of debt transfigured into one of taxation?
Answering this question offers more than colorful background; understanding how tax and debt politics fall contingently into particular parties (or out of the mainstream altogether) bridges the gap between rational choice preferences and Congressional representative voting outcomes.
My answer also connects taxes with expenditures, a non-trivial connection that will become very popular when individual preferences for social insurance are considered in the next chapter.


## Centering of Tax Policy by the Republican Party

I argue that the tax "revolts"^[To use Isaac Williams Martin's term.] kicked off by Proposition 13 in California brought to the fore the question of taxes.
Reagan's presidential campaign then finalized the centering of taxation in Republican domestic policy.
By centering taxation---and succeeding politically in its implementation---the Republican Party led voters to expect tax cuts and trained taxpayers to see themselves as a political class.
With taxation in the center, and Democrats playing a softer version of Republicans' tune, debt politics became illegible as politics, rendering any small resurgence as a social (rather than political) movement.

Despite some notable tax activism (see: Boston Tea Party), Americans were generally quiet about taxes well into the 20th century.
This phenomenon was no doubt largely because the federal income tax fell on no one, until 1913, or a tiny proportion (<6%) of the United States population until 1940.[@2019historical]
But after that point, the direction of tax expenditures---towards national defense in the beginning of the Cold War and for New Deal welfare programs such as the Social Security Act---were popular enough to discourage politicians from taking aim at tax cuts.[@campbell2009how, 160]
This equilibrium continued until the 1960s.
The fiscally-conservative Southern Democrats who controlled Congress' tax-writing committees[@campbell2009how, 162] were then voted out of office or changed party allegiances following federal enforcement of Civil Rights Movement legal judgements (such as *Brown v. Board of Education*), the passage of the Civil Rights and Voting acts, and finally Nixon's Southern Strategy in the 1970s.

Then, in 1978, Californians voted in favor of Proposition 13, which limited the property tax rate to 1%.
Proposition 13 emerged out of a long-fought battle by tax acvitists against the rationalization and modernization of property tax assessment.[@martin2008welcome]
Tax assessors declined to re-appraise property values at common intervals, leading to "fractional assessment" that, in 1971, "was ten times greater than the home mortgage interest deduction,"[@martin2008welcome, 9] which is often referenced as an invisible form of welfare to the rich.
The success of Proposition 13 realized the potential of anti-tax movements in post-war, post--New Deal American politics.
Interviews of Congressional staffers at the time referred to a 'Proposition 13 mentality'[@kingdon1995agendas, 97] and President Jimmy Carter said the result "sent a shock wave through the consciousness of every public servant."[@jarvis1979mad, 3]
Interestingly, Proposition 13 was not destined for the Republican platform from the outset; Isaac William Martin subverts this perception by noting the colorful array of leftists, hippies, anti-government organizers, and 9-to-5-ers that marched in the streets in support of the referendum, and President Carter's comment above highlights the immediacy with which Democrats understood Proposition 13's political effects.
Rather, it was Reagan's signature tax cuts that assimilated the anti-tax fervor to the Republican platform, and probably the visibility that Barry Goldwater---extreme as he was---enjoyed in his run for president.

It is important to note now where my account stands with regard to a theory of political change.
In \@ref(actors-motive), I briefly engaged farmer activism in the Great Depression, a mass movement that saw thousands pack courthouses and politicians' offices.
Here, I make a slight turn: while again activism prompted radical shifts in policy, the Republican turn did not feature near-intimidation tactics, nor did "an astonishing array of antediluvian automobiles [... swarm] over the capitol."[@fliter2012fighting]
The tax revolt "did not change what most people thought about taxes, [but] it *did* change how much the major parties paid attention to taxes."[@martin2008welcome, 127. Emphasis Martin.]
This transformation is closer to a theory of change from above than was the mortgage moratorium movement, but still firmly rooted in grass.
The next movements are much different; they see political strategists and small, connected groups of activists introduce citizens to ever more radical suggestions.
I understand this shift as taking place in a moment of transition: when there suddenly opens unsettled ground to be claimed, it is the elites who decide what flag it will fly.
The ground was unsettled in the sense that the partisan coding of anti-tax policies was ambiguous---the two parties had converged more or less---where Democrats had backed debt politics before the mortgage moratoria.

In the final centering of tax policy on the national level, Ronald Reagan was the agent of change.
The explosive success of Proposition 13 changed Reagan's mind on taxes.
Before, he had been convinced that tax limits would just shift the burden of taxation onto one of its other forms in personal or corporate taxation.[@martin2008welcome, 129]
This belief came from a connection made between revenue and expenditure, a logic of reaping what one sows.
In California, however, local governments did not collapse, and what changes did occur to the provision of social services evidently did not summon a pro-tax backlash; in other words, "you could cut taxes deeply without worrying about deficits."[@martin2008welcome, 130]
The reality about this de-coupling is very important to my argument.
There have *always* been large chunks of the federal budget that could legally be trimmed.
Yet, the focus of balancing the deficit rarely falls (and rarely fell) on this most massive discretionary chunk, military spending.
The purported want to balance budgets---echoed by every recent president---does not imply a need to contain visible (or invisible) welfare programs and transfers to local governments.
Rather, it is by political construction that programs like the Neighborhood Stabilization Program end up in budget debates.

Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign picked up on the Proposition 13 rhetoric, mentioning taxes in more times than any previous candidate had in his nomination acceptance speech.[@campbell2009what]
He offered tax cuts within a larger theory, connecting the private economic conditions with larger social problems.
These would respond, not to the popular New Deal provisions, but to the increase in expenditure caused by Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, not yet 20 years old.
Taxes were certainly not the only issue on his platform, but they are that for which he is remembered: the Iranian hostage situation and antidote to Jimmy Carter's "Crisis of Confidence" sermon were contingencies where taxes were a certainty.
And his signature tax cut---the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 that spurred savings and loan banks to sell off mortgages---led to a huge contemporary and lingering spike in popularity.(REFERENCE NEEDED)

After the reforms of the first term, the campaign ramped up its tax rhetoric.
\@ref(fig:acceptance) shows the massive spike in tax mentions in nomination acceptance speeches (left) and general election television ads (right), aligning with the 1984 election.
Bolstered by the knowledge that one could uncouple taxes from spending, Reagan was able to fend off Democratic challenger Walter Mondale's criticism that, "Mr. Reagan will raise taxes and so will I. He won't tell you."[@raines1984party]
Ronald Reagan would go on to win every state except Minnesota, Mondale's home.

```{r acceptance, fig.align='center', out.width='45%', fig.cap="Number of tax mentions by party in presidential nomination acceptance speeches (left); percentage of general election TV ads to feature taxation (right). Both charts from @campbell2009what."}
include_graphics(c("figure/campbell.png", "figure/campbell2.png"))
```

After Ronald Reagan, it was the House Republicans who fueled the drive towards lower taxes.
Isaac William Martin takes over here:

>Gingrich derided [balanced-budget Republicans'] argument afor tax increases as an "automatic, old-time Republican answer." He thereby implied that the *new* Republican answer was to cut taxes even when there was a deficit. After President Reagan signed tax increases in 1982 and 1983, Gingrich was instrumental in rewriting the Republican Party platform in 1984 to repudiate further tax increases. In 1990, he broke ranks with President George H. W. Bush and led House Republicans in voting down the president's budget---because it included a tax increase.[@martin2008welcome, 133]

I dwelt on Ronald Reagan's tenure because it was an inflection point in national politics.
The breakdown of Fordism in the United States, and its replacement by asset-backed political economy, was aided by Reagan's policies.
In contrast, the crystallization of taxation as dominant Republican issue, while crucial to telling the story of how past became present, is less important to understanding how housing and taxation function conceptually in American politics.

As such, I will race through Clinton's presidency with equal pace.
Notable in the Campbell graphs are the mentions of taxation by Democrats in the Clinton era.
So, while Gingrich drove legislation such as the Contract with America and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act through Congress, it was not he---nor Republicans---alone.
In addition, Clinton co-opted what had been Republican positions on welfare, and his labelling as a Third Way or New Democrat can be seen as trying to distance his politics from those of the party generally.
Clinton's focus on budget balance differed from what Reagan and Gingrich had pushed, re-coupling revenue with expenditure, but the expenditure in focus was (as always) welfare.
By "end[ing] welfare as we know it," Clinton coupled preference for social insurance with preference for higher taxes.
After Clinton, the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and John Kerry would return Democratic campaigns to emphasizing the need for higher taxes and more supportive (visible) welfare programs.

Following Isaac William Martin's argument about the importance of Proposition 13, I have argued that tax activism propelled Republican victories in the 1980s.
Successive legislative and electoral efforts would then de-couple taxes from government spending, leaving a narrow set of discretionary spending over which candidates and legislators could argue.
This set emphasized visible welfare programs (such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) that socialized insurance across teh tax base.
By centering taxes in the national conversation, debt politics became increasingly illegible to voters.
Additionally, the connection between welfare spending and taxes meant that those who felt secure financially would opt to keep otherwise-taxed income instead of the social insurance policies those funds were supposedly directed towards.
The connection between spending and taxation, however, fades from view somewhat in the early 21st century, as massive funds are appropriated for the War on Terror.
Reconnecting those threads are the work of anti-tax organizations and their allies in Congress.

## Emergence of the Tea Party

Economic crisis policy as massive, justifiable increase in government spending, tantamount to a massive increase in taxation

Santelli's rant

Rant turns debt relief into taxation issue on stock trading floor

Made legible to republican mainstream

Suddenly tax choices, even about debt relief, find their place within political narratives and as planks in party platforms

Astroturfing begets fundraising (Monica Prasad how perception of grassroots helped)

A self-identifying movement is born

## Conclusion

This movement makes identification in social sciences vewy vewy easy

The aggregation of individual preferences into party platforms is not an ahistorical task

Rather, the contingence of the current political moment makes or breaks the kind of economic political history that Ben Ansell tries to analyze

The Neighborhood Stabilization Program, in addressing spillover effects, raised---or arrested the fall of---neighboring home values.
Theoretically, I associate this movement with personal consumption in the same way that I associate pre-crisis home price increases with personal consumption: homeowners know that the (apparent) value of a home can be converted into a real stream of income.
By preserving home equity, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program buoyed owners through tumultuous labor conditions, or supplemented income as it may have before the mortgage crisis.
This thesis asks how voters prioritize these opposing forces.
