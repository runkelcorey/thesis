# Connecting Home Prices to Voting {#motive-opportunity}

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) countered the unfurling crisis with a hodgepodge of policies aimed, variously, at mitigating spillover effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
This aim congrued with the Bush administration's "ownership society", which added moral heft to the legal onus placed on individuals to become solely responsible for their own property.
By mitigating spillover effects, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program would attempt to isolate homes from the "animal spirits"[@keynes2007general] of the surrounding market(s), and focus success or failure of a person's finances on their own actions.
However, despite the ideological congruence between the NSP and Bush's ownership society, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program departed from the Republican Party by privatizing government money for less (or even negatively) affluent people.
In the United States, both Republican and Democratic parties have connected this action with higher taxation, and with the Democratic Party.
So, while the policies fit with the Bush administration, their ideological dimension tended more towards the Democratic Party.

But, as mentioned early in \@ref(actors-motive), opposing the leftward pull of ideology is the rightward push of rational choice.
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program, in addressing spillover effects, raised---or arrested the fall of---neighboring home values.
Theoretically, I associate this movement with personal consumption in the same way that I associate pre-crisis home price increases with personal consumption: homeowners know that the (apparent) value of a home can be converted into a real stream of income.
By preserving home equity, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program buoyed owners through tumultuous labor conditions, or even provided supplementary income.
