# An Unfurling Crisis {#actors-motive}

When 10 million Americans---1 of every 20 adults---lost their homes,[@martinForeclosedAmerica2015] it was clear that homeowners needed an intervention. When Countrywide, which two years earlier had serviced 20% of the mortgages in the United States,[@seabrooke2009politics] collapsed in July 2008, it was clear that the real estate industry needed to change.
When cities and counties around California, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona trembled at a declining tax base, it was clear that municipalities needed a break.
Yet, none of these actors wielded much power in the response to the subprime mortgage crisis.
Unlike the Great Depression, homeowners barely organized their political power and financial institutions imposed very modest debtor-relief programs.
Additionally, the long-term trend of municipal disinvestment emphasized the need to remove neighborhood blight instead of create or subsidize housing.

In reponse, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) authorized the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to distribute $3.9 billion to state and local governments for the purchase and repair of foreclosed properties.[@pelosiHousingEconomicRecovery2008]
This program, later termed the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), is my focus.
In purchasing, repairing, and in most cases reselling foreclosed properties, the NSP sought to mitigate the effects of foreclosures on their surroundings.
Primarily, foreclosures tear people from their homes.
On top of this comes the stigma of being a "deadbeat"[@dayenChainTitleHow2016] and mounds of fees---legal, cancellation, transportation-related.
But once homeowners have been forced out, the neighborhood and municipality bear the financial weight of that foreclosure.

To nearby homeowners, foreclosures cost $159,000 on average in decreased property values.[@immergluckPreventingNextMortgage2015]
To the city or county that envelops the property, it costs on average $64,000 for the legal and construction work to demolish and resell a vacant lot, parcels which tend to drop property values even further.
When property values drop, a home's [apparent] equity drops too.
This figure, estimated constantly by market research firms such as Zillow and appraised periodically by taxing authorities, determines to a large extent the wealth and borrowing power of homeowners.
If the value of an already-mortgaged home rises, homeowners can refinance.
Refinancing most often is used to take advantage of lower interest rates or decreased principal amounts in order to reduce monthly payments.
Refinancing in the subprime mortgage crisis, however, was used instead to finance renovations, service debt (eg. student, credit card, and car loans), or increase consumption.
Lending institutions willingly converted apparent value into real value, and as long as home values crept up, refinancing was viable.
This use of refinancing was derided as irresponsible shortly after the housing bubble burst,(REFERENCE NEEDED) but it rather reflected a shift in how Americans approached housing, from the home as an utterly private good, to the home as an asset.
Homes stand increasingly in the position of pension plans and 401ks; a wise move can transform forty years into four-hundred thousand dollars.

These wise moves seemd to occur constantly from September 1992 until March 2006.
As \@ref(fig:caseshiller) shows, the intervening 14 years never once saw a drop in the industry's standard home-price metric, the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.
As prices rose, homeowners refinanced, effectively paying back the first mortgage while taking out the second.
To investors in mortgage-backed securities (MBS), pre-payment from refinancing is usually seen as a risk, but constant and predictable refinance added to the safety of securitization, playing into investors risk-reward calculus.
But when prices fell---or even flatlined---this safety evaporated.
Without the increased [apparent] home equity, refinancing did nothing.
Falling prices thus meant homeowners were saddled with their current mortgage, often one whose interest rates reset after two years, climbing an interest-rate staircase for the next 28 years.
Atop the interest payments, living expenses (such as other debts) piled on to borrowers, where previously refinancing had arrived to supplement existing income with cash.
Falling prices meant homeowners chose among food, water, and shelter, if they had enough income for that to even be a decision.

These factors make homeowners *very* sensitive to falling or stagnant home prices.
In their sensitivity, they may vote for parties, candidates, and policies they believe will drive up home prices, such as property tax cuts, musucular code enforcement, and spacious zoning regulations.
Each policy reduces the resources available for non-homeowners.
For example, tax cuts, take they the form of directly-decreased property taxes or the homeowner tax credit, reduce the monies available to fund public goods.
In the United States, party ideology also ties higher taxes with explicitly redistributive policies, though Democrats and Republicans archetypically differ as to whether these policies are good or bad.
The rigidity of these ideologies with respect to the implications of tax rates rationalizes the fear that rents extracted from higher taxation will not return to the homeowners.
Circling back to the original home-price dynamic, higher home values fund greater consumption.
Lower property values and higher taxes (as they always have) limit peoples' capacities to spend, an activity Americans very much enjoy.
This alleged interest---the subject of later chapters---pits homeowners against renters, the homeless, and anyone else without a direct financial stake in the asset.

When prices rose, creditor and debor interests laid at some angle, intersecting in the particular case of safe, two-year refinancing, but divergent in the general case of refinancing for lower interest rates.
But falling housing prices conformed the immediate interests of creditors and debtors to one another, since delinquency and default eliminated any chance of extracting further rents.
Fears of a debt spiral triggered by falling home prices also beset cities(NEED REFERENCE) (though those fears appear to be ultimately unjustified[NEED REFERENCE FOR FED ARTICLE]).
With these interests in syzygy, why didn't homeowners, investors, or cities assert solutions, even ones that were done chiefly in their own interest?
I argue in this chapter that each suffered from collective action problems, a critique I believe to be sufficient, though by no means necessary, to explaining why each was functionally barred from addressing the housing problem.
Additionally, I give an historical sketch of the shifting burden of economic policy from state-level to national-level that could explain why states did not shoulder the largest load.

This argument functions triple purposes.
First, it justifes the motives of actors external to the creation of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, to which internal actors, such as George W. Bush and members of Congress, responded.
Second, it offers a story about why external actors may not have acted decisively.
Third, this chapter buttresses the above theory of voting with more general insights from political economy literature.
Readers should come away from this chapter understanding why federal foreclosure relief programs were necessary and how the subprime mortgage crisis challenges previous theories of asset-based voting.
