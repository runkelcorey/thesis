# Asset Prices, Individual Preferences, and Foreclosure Relief {#methods}

How do asset prices affect voter decisions *in extremis*?
Political economy has investigated the impacts of income on voter behavior, labor market risk on social insurance preferences, housing on voter behavior, and home value on welfare demand.
But it has not investigated how such policy preferences represent themselves in political decision-making, nor the priority of relative changes in home price versus the absolute level of home prices, dynamics relevant to the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which aimed to affect neighborhoods in greatest need.
This thesis seeks to untie these last two knots by modeling vote outcomes, while this chapter moves from groups to individuals.

This chapter moves from groups to individuals by reviewing the relevant literature on asset-based social insurance preferences, psychology of lost and gained wealth, and American voting behavior.
It works towards a model of voting that will be used to analyze returns from the 2010 midterm elections, when the Tea Party experienced its first and greatest victories.
To give handles which readers can grasp, I will simultaneously describe the measures and data used for my analysis.
This chapter stands logically between my last two.
It describes how the financial crisis---whose characteristics were explored in \@ref(actors-motive)---mutated individual preferences, preferences which could then be located in the political landscape described in \@ref(motive-opportunity).

At base, I describe individual consumption preferences from a life cycle/permanent income perspective.
Milton Friedman opened his foundational work in life-cycle analysis by noting "Keynes took it for granted that current consumption expenditure is a highly dependable and stable function of current income."[@friedman1957introduction, 1]
Keynes understood economic fluctuations and crises as products of the past and present, as gluts or dearths of savings.[@keynes2007general]
What future tense factored into his understanding was almost immediate---the momentary "animal spirits", for instance, or the undulations of the business cycle which trigger liquidity traps---rather than the long patterns highlighted by Kuznets.
Friedman addressed the idea that individuals' income derives not simply from current income, or previous savings, but from all future earnings.
In an extreme example, a toddler able to form "rational" (some fuzziness on this term's definition) expectations of future income could finance their upbringing and education by borrowing aginst those predictions, this would be a rational choice for both toddler and financier.
This framework sees wealth, and therefore housing, as potentially permanent income.

But housing can also be used as a financial "buffer stock" against emergencies.
This refinement is motivated by historical facts about American saving habits.[@carroll1997bufferstock, 1]
57% of respondents to the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) who reported saving, saved for retirement or unexpected expenses, a slowly rising trend.
And when 2016's figures are disaggregated by income, they change substantially.
Under $40,000, 53% of respondents saved for unexpected expenses, compared to just 37% who saved for retirement.(UPDATE TO 2007)
In addition, more than half of respondents with household income below $40,000 a year, and a quarter of those between \$40,000 and \$100,000 did not save at all.[@buchholz2016federal, 64-65]

These understandings of housing as an asset are not foreign to homeowners.
1982, the year following Reagan's Economic Recovery Tax Act, simultaneously saw a 35-year high for personal savings and 35-year low for mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW), as a percentage of disposable income.
By 2005, these lows and highs had flipped.
\@ref(fig:mew) shows the outstanding inverse relationship between the ratios of personal saving and MEW to disposable income.
Further, mortgage equity has greater wealth effects than investments in stocks or bonds: XXXX found YYY more cents of every dollar of morgtage equity withdrawn.
There is disagreement among economists as to the cause and level of this wealth effect, but the fact that this effect is greater than other financial holding is broadly agreed upon, and fits into the view that America has transitioned into a consumption- and import-oriented economy.

```

In fact, these understandings shape homeowners' political decisions.

These effects are not unique to housing, but they are most significant in housing.

This importance is due to the sheer size and volatility of housing since 1981.

Additionally, housing in the United States is a particularly salient issue politically.

Subsidizing housing and home mortgages privatizes government spending we would otherwise recognize as welfare.

By privatizing, these subsidies individualize housing gains, differentiating this form of "invisible welfare" from the bureaucratic programs debated by the Republican and Democratic parties.

Nonetheless, I argue they are substitutable for homeowners: preference for this private form of insurance reduces the demand for social insurance programs.

Interesting to note is a sociological perspective of this phenomenon not as life-cycle analysis via Friedman, but as *embourgeoisiement*.

Under the narrative pushed around 2010, income and spending are connected.
Therefore, lower preference for social insurance expenditure justifies preferences for lower taxation.

As I explained in \@ref(motive-opportunity), these preferences represent as votes for Republican candidates, especially those in the Tea Party.

It is important to understand that, just like the contingencies of party platforms, there are contingencies in how individuals process economic data.
Partisanship affects how this process plays out; therefore, not all voters *could* (let alone *would*) be affected by asset prices.

Therefore, my model aims at marginal voters, THOSE LIKELY TO SWING ELECTIONS.

And I expect the effects to be marginal, as the Neighborhood Stabilization Program likely enriched no one.

But the NSP featured little advertisement and received little press in return.

While these factors simplify my analysis and attenuate its potential for strong conclusions, my model is complicated by the way that humans value an equal amount of money lost and gained.

This confusion collides with the ambiguity between the change in wealth and the absolute value of wealth.

Additionally, the intimacy with foreclosure and bankruptcy both financially and sociologically may factor into this analysis.

Is it likely that those nearing foreclosure understand the precarity of their financial position and the benefits of social insurance?

Further, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program targeted neighborhoods rife with foreclosure---not individual homes.
Could physical distance alter voting decisions, regardless of wealth?
