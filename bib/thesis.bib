  institution = {{Working Paper}},
  abstract = {In the wake of the Great Depression, the Federal government created new institutions such as the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) to stabilize housing markets. As part of that effort, the HOLC created residential security maps for over 200 cities to grade the riskiness of lending to neighborhoods. We trace out the effects of these maps over the course of the 20th and into the early 21st century by linking geocoded HOLC maps to both Census and modern credit bureau data. Our analysis looks at the difference in outcomes between residents living on a lower graded side versus a higher graded side of an HOLC boundary within highly close proximity to one another. We compare these differences to "counterfactual" boundaries using propensity score and other weighting procedures. In addition, we exploit borders that are least likely to have been endogenously drawn. We find that areas that were the lower graded side of HOLC boundaries in the 1930s experienced a marked increase in racial segregation in subsequent decades that peaked around 1970 before beginning to decline. We also find evidence of a long-run decline in home ownership, house values, and credit scores along the lower graded side of HOLC borders that persists today. We document similar long-run patterns among both "redlined" and non-redlined neighborhoods and, in some important outcomes, show larger and more lasting effects among the latter. Our results provide strongly suggestive evidence that the HOLC maps had a causal and persistent effect on the development of neighborhoods through credit access.},

To study the novel, we define Garc{\'i}a M{\'a}rquez's response to the political condition of Latin America in the backdrop of the postcolonial paradigm. Highlighting that magical realism enables a writer to challenge the authenticity of the so-called objective reality and at the same time attempts to ``write back to the Centre'' (Ashcroft, Griffiths, and Tiffin 1989, ix), we draw attention to the technique of magical realism as an important tool employed to register social protest against the lingering effects of the process of colonialism. We also address the question as to how the moments of magical realism in the novel overlap with various historical dimensions of Latin America, especially Colombia`s ability to raise constructs of protest of varying degrees.},

Foreclosures are modeled to depend on depressed farm earnings throughout the 1920s and 1930s, optimistic agricultural expansion brought on by World War I, and cross-state variation in mortgage debt structure. The empirical results are consistent with the proposed multiple causal model.},

Locally, suburban and rural counties are often Red, urban counties Blue. This overgeneralization misses the Republican share of urban centers. This study analyzes the 2000\textendash{}2012 presidential elections in core counties of metropolitan areas with populations over 250,000. Possible explanations for urban election outcomes cover three theoretical groupings: sociodemographics, culture, and economics. Several prominent explanatory variables from each are compared. Changes from 2000\textendash{}2004 to 2008\textendash{}2012 are highlighted given the 2008 economic crash and President Obama's race and urban identity, which permitted him to cut President Bush's core county share in half. Regression analyses find that sociodemographic and cultural features account for most variation for all elections, while economic indicators add little explanatory power. In contrast to conventional thinking, economics mattered most in 2004, culture increased in importance in 2008\textendash{}2012, and urban foreclosures positively influenced McCain in 2008.},

Yet political economists have had little to say about how this critical phenomenon affects citizens' welfare and their demands from government. This article develops a novel theoretical argument linking housing prices to social policy preferences and policy outcomes. I argue that homeowners experiencing house price appreciation will become less supportive of redistribution and social insurance policies since increased house prices both increase individuals' permanent income and the value of housing as self-supplied insurance against income loss. Political parties of the right will, responding to these preferences, cut social spending substantially during housing booms. I test these propositions using both microdata on social preferences from panel surveys in the USA, the UK, and a cross-country survey of 29 countries, and macrodata of national social spending for 18 countries between 1975 and 2001.},

  abstract = {"Modern historiography embraces the notion that time is irreversible, implying that the past should be imagined as something "absent" or "distant." Victims of historical injustice, however, in contrast, often claim that the past got "stuck" in the present and that it retains a haunting presence. History, Memory, and State-Sponsored Violence is centered around the provocative thesis that the way one deals with historical injustice and the ethics of history is strongly dependent on the way one conceives of historical time; that the concept of time traditionally used by historians is structurally more compatible with the perpetrators than the victims point of view. Demonstrating that the claim of victims about the continuing presence of the past should be taken seriously, instead of being treated as merely metaphorical, Berber Bevernage argues that a genuine understanding of the irrevocable past demands a radical break with modern historical discourse and the concept of time. By embedding a profound philosophical reflection on the themes of historical time and historical discourse in a concrete series of case studies, this project transcends the traditional divide between empirical historiography on the one hand and the so called theoretical approaches to history on the other. It also breaks with the conventional analytical philosophy of history that has been dominant during the last decades, raising a series of long-neglected big questions about the historical condition questions about historical time, the unity of history, and the ontological status of present and past programmatically pleading for a new historical ethics"--},

  abstract = {Background:
Lack of access to adequate prenatal health is an important and potentially modifiable risk factor. Transportation (or a lack thereof) is a known barrier to accessing care among low-income women.

Objective:
Guided by critical theory, this study illustrates the value of interpretative mapping to deconstruct bus travel to publicly funded prenatal care in a city marked by health and social inequities.

Design:
Using geographical information systems (GIS) approach, this mixed methods study delves deeper into the known barrier of transportation to prenatal care among urban mothers most at risk for preterm birth by employing iterative processes among data, analysis, and interpretation.

Methods:
GIS maps developed based on 61,305 births directed neighborhood field excursions for which researchers and key informants created a `typical case vignette.' Multiple service locations for required components of prenatal care were geocoded. Time and money spent traveling with public transit were modeled using ArcMap's Network Analyst.

Results:
Among 350 census tracts, 36 census tracts had preterm rates between 25 -36.9\%. Modeling travel time for the case vignette for routine prenatal care took 21 visits to different geographically located facilities. This burden increased to 32 visits if the case vignette was high-risk.

Conclusions:
Interpretative GIS mapping is an important tool to ground truth spatially linked data into real world meaning to promote deeper understandings of complex problems. Time and cost traveling by bus to prenatal care that entailed various locations travel did not account for other related hassles of getting and waiting for care for mothers with young toddlers in tow. Promoting optimal health outcomes among the most at risk mothers requires innovative and feasible approaches that take into consideration daily maternal functioning as pregnant mothers care for their children and themselves.

Impact Statement
Ground truthing data-driven GIS maps with key informant community-based nurses is an important method to consider globally to garner deeper community and family health understandings for future actions.},

Using data on welfare participants, low-wage jobs, and public transit in Los Angeles County, an examination was made of the relative access that welfare participants have to employment opportunities. The analysis shows that welfare participants' access to employment varies dramatically depending on their residential location and commute mode. Many welfare participants live in job-rich neighborhoods and are able to reach numerous jobs without difficulty by either car or public transit. Others, however, live in job-poor neighborhoods where a reliance on public transit significantly reduces their access to employment. In these neighborhoods long and unreliable commutes on public transit often severely limit their ability to find and reliably travel to and from work. Therefore, given the distinctly uneven patterns of employment opportunities in metropolitan areas, policies to address the transportation needs of welfare participants should be targeted to reflect the characteristics of the neighborhoods in which welfare participants live.},

Two theoretical frameworks dominate in relation to planning and democracy \textendash{} Habermasian-inspired communicative planning theory and Mouffe's agonistic pluralism. Both theoretical frames are typically held to be incommensurable because of fundamental ontological and epistemological differences and the debate between proponents of each tends to be polemic. Both theories have complementary strengths and weaknesses in terms of the insights they are capable of providing. Moreover, the realities of urban governance situations often display characteristics that can be explained in terms of both theoretical framings. This article negotiates a path beyond the polemic debate. It problematizes both theoretical frameworks and negotiates a way forward for planning theory that co-opts the principles of one into a theoretical framework that assumes the ontological position of the other. In so doing the article proposes a two-pronged approach that provides a critical, adaptive and reflexive approach to inquiring into spaces of urban democracy.},

ArcGIS software was used to create a geographic information system (GIS) incorporating relevant data from a variety of sources. Individual and overlay maps were then produced to examine the aims of this analysis. Data showed that Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and poverty status tend to co-occur spatially among seniors in Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx. Further, a spatial/transportation barrier may inhibit access to dental care for seniors who reside in these areas. By presenting multiple layers of local information juxtaposed, GIS can help provide directions for planning oral health service delivery for seniors.},

  abstract = {Does women's empowerment strengthen global good citizenship? We test theories of democratic foreign policy and feminist international relations that suggest that more deeply democratic countries with greater gender equity will be stronger international human rights promoters. First, the direct empowerment of women as policymakers and civil society constituencies may shift states' incentives and ability to pursue international human rights initiatives. Second, greater sexual equality may lead to feminist socialization of the wider society to promote human rights values. We test these predictions by measuring the relationship between five different measures of sexual equality and a country's propensity to support 30 international human rights outcomes, including legal commitments, humanitarian assistance, and sanctions, controlling for previously established contributing factors such as level of development and democratic regime type. We find that more sexually equal countries are more likely to support international commitments to constrain state violence against individuals, international measures to combat gender and sexual orientation discrimination, and more and higher quality development assistance. However, sexual equality appears to yield less benefit for more costly human rights initiatives: yielding sovereignty to international legal institutions, promoting economic rights through concessionary trade policies, or adopting diplomatic sanctions against pariah states. These effects are stronger in democratic states, where citizen empowerment translates more readily into foreign policy, and are also found in a sample that excludes the Western powers.},

One highly localized form of government is a homeowners' association (HOA). HOAs could be well suited for triaging foreclosures, as they may detect delinquencies and looming defaults through direct observation or missed dues. On the other hand, the reliance on dues may leave HOAs particularly vulnerable to members' foreclosure. We examine how property prices respond to homeowner distress and foreclosure within HOA communities in Florida. We combine datasets of HOAs, sales and aggregate loan delinquency and foreclosures from 2000 through 2008. We find properties in HOAs are relatively less impacted by more distressed neighbor homes compared to non-HOA properties, but only when considering less severe delinquency rates. We also find that negative price effects from higher delinquency exposure rates are ameliorated for properties in larger and newer HOAs.},

The findings more generally reinforce the impression that Tea Party activists varied in the extent of their broader political vision and strategic acumen. On the one hand, many gathered together to express dissent and make their opposition identity known wherever they happened to live. But some did unite with like-minded groups to direct their activity toward defeating incumbents, capturing open seats, and electing their own candidates, possibly altering the outcome in a number of elections, primary and general. A geographic perspective on movement activism reveals that while not remarkably strategic with respect to the 2010 elections, Tea Party protest was not purely expressive either.},

  abstract = {Background
Walking, and in particular, outdoor walking, is the most common form of physical activity for older adults. To date, no study investigated the association between the neighborhood built environment and physical activity habits of older adults of low SES. Thus, our overarching aim was to examine the association between the neighborhood built environment and the spectrum of physical activity and walking for transportation in older adults of low socioeconomic status.

Methods
Cross-sectional data were from the Walk the Talk Study, collected in 2012. Participants (n\,=\,161, mean age\,=\,74~years) were in receipt of a rental subsidy for low income individuals and resided in neighbourhoods across Metro Vancouver, Canada. We used the Street Smart Walk Score to objectively characterize the built environment main effect (walkability), accelerometry for objective physical activity, and the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire to measure walking for transportation. We used regression analyses to examine associations of objectively measured physical activity [total volume, light intensity and moderate intensity physical activity (MVPA)] and self-reported walking for transportation (any, frequency, duration) with walkability. We adjusted analyses for person- and environment-level factors associated with older adult physical activity.

Results
Neighbourhood walkability was not associated with physical activity volume or intensity and self-reported walking for transportation, with one exception. Each 10-point increase in Street Smart Walk Score was associated with a 45\% greater odds of any walking for transportation (compared with none; OR\,=\,1.45, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.18, 1.78). Sociodemographic, physical function and attitudinal factors were significant predictors of physical activity across our models.

Conclusions
The lack of associations between most of the explored outcomes may be due to the complexity of the relation between the person and environment. Given that this is the first study to explore these associations specifically in older adults living on low income, this study should be replicated in other settings.},

The total revenue of all global fabless firms in 2003 was about US\$20 billion, with the top 30 firms earning accounting for 96\% of the market share. To examine the leaders in the field, this research analyzes the relative performances of those top 30 fabless firms. Fabless firms are often evaluated based on subjective judgments, and an overall scheme to measure the performance involving objective, multi-input and multi-output criteria is yet to be established. There is also a need for identifying and determining suggestions of how specific firms could improve their performance. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method has been employed in this paper to satisfy the above needs. Using the input and output data of 2003, this study used the DEA method to build a model to evaluate the performance of those global top 30 fabless firms. The current research used four efficiency models: CCR, A\&P, BCC, and Cross-Efficiency. To offer a comparison of efficiencies and associated discussions, an analysis of the Scale-Return is provided. Finally, the performance of various fabless firms in 2003 is analyzed. According to the CCR and A\&P models, the results showed that the top ten Decision Management Units (DMUs) achieved better operation performance among the 30 leading global fabless firms.

This study adds to that literature by focusing on the ways in which public housing availability, changes in housing policy, and rural economic restructuring create opportunities for low-income families to relocate from urban to rural communities in search of affordable housing. Data collected from an ethnographic sample addressed the following questions: (1) what motivates individuals and families to leave their urban neighborhoods and relocate to rural towns and (2) what challenges do individuals and families have in sustaining stable housing in rural communities? Two main sets of literature relevant to this discussion include studies of patterns of residential mobility and explanations of rural economic restructuring. Both form the conceptual approach of this article by offering a framework to better understand the housing choices and behaviors of low-income families and the contexts in which these actions are situated.},

This paper tests the extent to which distressed mortgage borrowers benefit from three types of state foreclosure polices: (1) judicial foreclosure proceedings, (2) statutory rights of redemption, and (3) statewide foreclosure-prevention initiatives. Based on an analysis of borrowers in default who reside in 22 cross-state metropolitan statistical area pairs, state policies generally have weak effects. Both judicial foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure prevention initiatives are associated with modest increases in loan modification rates.

  abstract = {An institution is defined as collective action in control, liberation and expansion of individual action. Its forms are unorganized custom and organized going concerns. The individual action is participation in bargaining, managing and rationing transactions, which are the ultimate units of economic activity. The Control by custom or concerns consists in working rules which govern more or less what the individual can, must, or may do or not do. These are choices, resolved into performance, forbearance or avoidance while participating in transactions. The working rule of the Supreme Court is due process of law. The universal principles, that is, similarities of cause, effect, or purpose, discoverable in all transactions, are scarcity, efficiency, futurity, working rules and limiting factors under volitional control. These reveal themselves in a negotiational, or behavioristic, psychology of persuasion and coercion in bargaining transactions, command and obedience in managerial transactions, argument and pleading in rationing transactions. Transactions determine legal control, while the classical and hedonic economics was concerned with physical control. Legal control is future physical control. The three social relations implicit in translations are conflict, dependence and order. Social philosophies differ economically according to the kind of transactions which they place uppermost.},

An important gap exists, however, in our current approach: a uniquely effective building block for developing crisis-fighting skills is relevant experience, but the infrequency of crises translates to a dearth of opportunities for regulators to attain the necessary experience and develop the pertinent skills. This Article proposes to fill this gap by employing role-playing crisis simulations\textemdash{}or wargames\textemdash{}to create synthetic crisis-fighting experiences. Wargames can provide regulators with a repertoire of crisis experiences that they will have ``lived,'' in a real if attenuated way, which can then aid them in perceiving key patterns and anomalies and in anticipating potential consequences of decisions to intervene (or not) under the intense time pressure and stress of an actual crisis.},

Lisa Epstein, Michael Redman, and Lynn Szymoniak did not work in government or law enforcement. They had no history of anticorporate activism. Instead they were all foreclosure victims, and while struggling with their shame and isolation they committed a revolutionary act: closely reading their mortgage documents, discovering the deceit behind them, and building a movement to expose it. Fiscal Times columnist David Dayen recounts how these ordinary Floridians challenged the most powerful institutions in America armed only with the truth-and for a brief moment they brought the corrupt financial industry to its knees"--},

In this paper, we exploit this heterogeneity to estimate the extent to which the boom was spread via spatial spillovers from one market to another. Our analysis focuses on spillovers that occur around the time that a local market enters its boom, which we identify using sharp structural breaks in house price growth rates. On the extensive margin, there is evidence that the likelihood of a market booming increases substantially if nearby neighbors boom. On the intensive margin, we also find statistically significant but economically modest effects of the size of a neighbor's boom on subsequent price growth in nearby markets. These affects appear to be unrelated to local market fundamentals, suggesting a potential role for non-rational factors.},

DESIGN AND SAMPLE: A cross-sectional, retrospective design was used. The sample of 1800 low-income women was drawn from Welfare, Children and Families: A Three-City Study (a study of low-income women from three U.S. cities).
MEASURES: Using multilevel modeling and geographic information systems, the study sought to determine the effect of distance to public transportation and residential density on health status, mental health symptoms, and health-related limitations.
RESULTS: No significant relationship was found between the two walkability metrics and health outcomes. Instead, neighborhood problems that affect crime and safety impacted health status and mental health symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: As cities make changes to the built environment with the hope of affecting residents' health outcomes, public health nurses need to be aware that changing walkability characteristics in a neighborhood may not affect the health of residents of high crime, low-income neighborhoods. Without first addressing neighborhood crime, efforts to improve walkability in low-income neighborhoods may fail.},

  abstract = {Some recent literature has concluded that patent remedies result in systematically excessive royalties because of holdup and stacking problems. This article shows that this literature is mistaken. The royalty rates predicted by the holdup models are often (plausibly most of the time) below the true optimal rate. Further, those predicted royalty rates are overstated because of incorrect assumptions about constant demand, one-shot bargaining, and informational symmetry. Although this literature concludes that overcompensation problems are exacerbated by doctrines measuring damages using past negotiated royalties, in fact such doctrines exacerbate undercompensation problems. Undercompensation problems are further increased to the extent that juries cannot measure damages with perfect accuracy, a problem that persists even if damages are just as likely to be overestimated as underestimated. Nor do the royalty rates predicted by the holdup model apply if there is competition in the downstream product market or upstream market for inventions. Royalty stacking does not lead to royalties that exceed the optimal rate, contrary to this literature, but in fact tends to produce royalties that are at or below the optimal rate.

Drawing on planning and feminist theory, philosophy and case study, this paper discusses promoting participatory practices in planning for equity, better policy, and the public good. The public interest is promoted through building relationships and social networks as well as education and community organizing of all, but especially marginalized and oppressed groups. Collaboration empowers individuals and broadens the information and decision-making possibilities for all parties. Participation based strategies develop engagement and equalize power differentials. Gathering together disparate interests enables effective discourse, deliberation, and education. Public engagement and feedback builds direct governance, creates new forms of power, and helps level the hegemonic playing field. Both institutional, top-down and grassroots, bottom-up activism engage citizens as active stakeholders in their community directly promoting democracy. Barriers in funding, evaluation, politics, political economy, developing pedagogical techniques, and power differentials are discussed.},

This review article contributes to the literature by classifying spatial mismatch mitigation strategies into four groups and evaluating the successes and failures of each strategy group. The evaluation finds that empirical evidence on most strategies is inconsistent and the effectiveness of those strategies remains unclear, yet research examining car ownership programs consistently shows positive effects. The article concludes by recommending planners to expand their support for car ownership programs, test the effectiveness of the more recent, coordinated policy programs, and pay attention to nonspatially related employment barriers such as discrimination, social support, and human capital factors.},

The second study used multiple methods to analyze Census data, vehicle registration lists, and focus group interviews to identify transportation resources in a rural county and to assess transportation needs and barriers facing welfare recipients. The third study addressed the association between transportation and economic outcomes using a dual frame household survey in a cluster of five counties.

  abstract = {An influential literature claims that standard setting for high-technology interoperable products potentially creates monopoly power for the owners of standard-essential patents. Moreover, because there are many owners of standard-essential patents, and each may independently exercise monopoly power (a phenomenon called royalty stacking), an anticommons tragedy may ensue. With actual data from the canonical case of the smartphone industry, this Article shows that royalty stacking theory predicts a cumulative royalty yield of nearly eighty percent. That is, it predicts that four-fifths of the price of a smartphone will accrue to patent holders. Even if all patent holders would combine to eliminate the tragedy of the anticommons and behave as a single monopolist, theory predicts a cumulative royalty yield of nearly sixty-seven percent. That is, it predicts that two-thirds of the price of a smartphone will accrue to patent holders. This Article then uses actual data from licensors in the smartphone value chain to estimate the actual cumulative royalty yield. It finds that in 2016, the cumulative royalty yield in the world smartphone value chain was only 3.4 percent of the average selling price of a smartphone. This suggests that patent holders do not exercise any meaningful monopoly power to increase prices in the world smartphone market, much less that there is an anticommons tragedy in the smartphone industry.

The analyzed data reveal no adverse consequences of hold-up and royalty stacking in terms of harm to the standard-setting process, reductions in the rate of innovation, or levels of R\&D investment: It is alleged that those seeking to justify the significant reforms to the FRAND regime on the basis of hold-up and royalty stacking have not met the burden of proof that these reforms are necessary or even desirable.

It draws on three streams of literature \textendash{} transaction costs economics, production networks, and technological capability and firm-level learning \textendash{} to identify three variables that play a large role in determining how global value chains are governed and change. These are: (1) the complexity of transactions, (2) the ability to codify transactions, and (3) the capabilities in the supply-base. The theory generates five types of global value chain governance \textendash{} hierarchy, captive, relational, modular, and market \textendash{} which range from high to low levels of explicit coordination and power asymmetry. The article highlights the dynamic and overlapping nature of global value chain governance through four brief industry case studies: bicycles, apparel, horticulture and electronics.},

  abstract = {U.S. immigrants have faced a changing landscape with regard to immigration enforcement over the last two decades. Following the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and the creation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency after the attacks of September 11, 2001, detention and deportation activity increased substantially. As a result, immigrants today are experiencing heightened fear of profiling and deportation. Little research exists on how these activities affect the health and well-being of U.S. immigrant communities. This study sought to address this gap by using community-based participatory research to investigate the impact of enhanced immigration enforcement on immigrant health in Everett, Massachusetts, USA, a city with a large and diverse immigrant population. Community partners and researchers conducted 6 focus groups with 52 immigrant participants (documented and undocumented) in five languages in May 2009. The major themes across the groups included: 1) Fear of deportation, 2) Fear of collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE and perception of arbitrariness on the part of the former and 3) Concerns about not being able to furnish documentation required to apply for insurance and for health care. Documented and undocumented immigrants reported high levels of stress due to deportation fear, which affected their emotional well-being and their access to health services. Recommendations from the focus groups included improving relationships between immigrants and local police, educating immigrants on their rights and responsibilities as residents, and holding sessions to improve civic engagement. Immigration enforcement activities and the resulting deportation fear are contextual factors that undermine trust in community institutions and social capital, with implications for health and effective integration processes. These factors should be considered by any community seeking to improve the integration process.},

  abstract = {It has been 20 years since the World Trade Organization and its law came into operation, accompanied by much speculation about its effects on member states' powers to meet their international human rights law obligations. This article sets out what has been learnt over that period about the relationship between WTO law, principally the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ('GATT') and human rights law. While there have been no formal disputes during this period expressly invoking the core human rights treaties, much can be deduced from WTO jurisprudence. It is evident that there is normative tension between the trade and human rights domains, both in terms of the ends they pursue and the means they adopt. We argue that mooted solutions to this tension, such as interpreting WTO law in light of human rights law or applying human rights law directly in WTO disputes, face considerable obstacles and appear to have limited prospects. More radical solutions, such as amending WTO law, would yield better results, but would be very difficult to achieve. However, WTO jurisprudence suggests that it is possible to design some human rights measures to avoid non-compliance with WTO law disciplines, so long as the measures are very carefully structured and the policy process well-executed. This article focuses on GATT obligations and on the GATT art XX exception as a window through which human rights measures may potentially pass. To illustrate, we present two hypothetical, trade-affecting human rights measures to show both the prospects of such measures securing compliance with WTO law and how far the boundaries of compliance can be pushed within the existing paradigm.},

This study sought to evaluate PMN across 1 metropolitan area and assess relationships with underlying zip code\textendash{}level measures.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using data extracted from 1 regional community pharmacy market-share leader (October 2016\textendash{}April 2017). Data included patient age, sex, payer, medication type, and home zip code. This zip code was connected to US census measures enumerating poverty and vehicle access, which were treated as continuous variables and within quintiles. The prescription-level outcome was whether prescriptions were not filled within 30 days of reaching the pharmacy. The ecological-level outcome was PMN calculated for each zip code (numerator, unfilled prescriptions; denominator, received prescriptions).
RESULTS: There were 213 719 prescriptions received by 54 included pharmacies; 12.2\% were unfilled. Older children, boys, and those with public insurance were more likely to have prescriptions not filled. Prescriptions originating from the highest poverty quintile were significantly more likely to not be filled than those from the lowest poverty quintile (adjusted odds ratio 1.60; 95\% confidence interval 1.52\textendash{}1.69); a similar pattern was noted for vehicle access (adjusted odds ratio 1.77; 95\% confidence interval 1.68\textendash{}1.87). At the ecological level, there were significant, graded relationships between PMN rates and poverty and vehicle access (both P {$<$} .0001); these gradients extended across all medication classes.
CONCLUSIONS: Poverty and vehicle access are related to significant differences in prescription- and ecological-level PMN across 1 metropolitan area. Pharmacists and pharmacies can be key partners in population health efforts.},

  abstract = {Although women remain underrepresented in national politics throughout the world, they have also made significant progress toward equality in recent decades. Yet, for the almost 2 billion women living under regimes with limited political rights and civil liberties, we know little about the processes that facilitate their entry into politics. One broad mechanism that may impact women under both democratic and closed systems is elite turnover. In this article, I compare two routes to elite turnover, elections and legislative interruptions, and assess their impact on women's parliamentary representation. Legislative interruptions refer to any undemocratic or unconstitutional break in a country's legislature lasting at least six months. I explore the effects of elections and legislative interruptions on women's parliamentary representation using data from the Women in Parliaments Longitudinal Project, which covers more than 150 countries. Analyzing the likelihood that women will achieve 10 percent in parliament between 1950 and 2000, I find that the effect of legislative interruptions is similar in magnitude to the effect of democratic elections. Although breaks lasting three to ten years increase the likelihood that women will reach the 10 percent threshold, the effect of the longest legislative breaks is negative. Interruptions are also less effective vehicles for representation when considering more significant barriers\textemdash{}15 percent and 20 percent women in parliament. Across each of these outcomes, frequent interruptions hinder women's political progress. In sum, nondemocratic routes to elite turnover can foster real gains in women's representation, but only when legislative breaks are rare. Furthermore, nondemocratic routes to elite turnover are ultimately less effective than regular democratic elections at facilitating high levels of women in politics.},

Yet at every turn, landlords linked to local and regional political machines and military and police officials blocked or reversed reforms designed to modernise the countryside, as government-subsidised agro-industrial development replaced smallholding. Then, in successive conjunctures, landlords and their allies, including cocaine exporters from whom they were increasingly inseparable after 1985, augmented their political power through dynamic counterinsurgent paramilitary movements based in provincial cities and towns. This made democracy impossible, led to a new feudalism characterised by parcellised sovereignties, and upheld, into the twenty-first century, the semi-authoritarian parliamentary system that has ruled Colombia since the 1880s.},

  abstract = {Over the last two years, the United States has observed, with some horror, the explosion and collapse of entire segments of the housing market, especially those driven by subprime and alternative or "exotic" home mortgage lending. The unfortunately timely Foreclosed explains the rise of high-risk lending and why these newer types of loans\textemdash{}and their associated regulatory infrastructure\textemdash{}failed in substantial ways. Dan Immergluck narrates the boom in subprime and exotic loans, recounting how financial innovations and deregulation facilitated excessive risk-taking, and how these loans have harmed different populations and communities. Immergluck, who has been working, researching, and writing on issues tied to housing finance and neighborhood change for almost twenty years, has an intimate knowledge of the promotion of homeownership and the history of mortgages in the United States. The changes to the mortgage market over the past fifteen years\textemdash{}including the securitization of mortgages and the failure of regulators to maintain control over a much riskier array of mortgage products\textemdash{}led, he finds, inexorably to the current crisis. After describing the development of generally stable and risk-limiting mortgage markets throughout much of the twentieth century, Foreclosed details how federal policy-makers failed to regulate the new high-risk lending markets that arose in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The book also examines federal, state, and local efforts to deal with the mortgage and foreclosure crisis of 2007 and 2008. Immergluck draws upon his wealth of experience to provide an overarching set of principles and a detailed set of policy recommendations for "righting the ship" of U.S. housing finance in ways that will promote affordable yet sustainable homeownership as an option for a broad set of households and communities.},

There is a general consensus in the literature on political representation that countries applying a proportional representation (PR) system have a higher number of women in their national parliaments than those with single-member, first-past-the-post systems. This is primarily because parties can be encouraged to craft a balanced party list, reflecting the wide range of interests, social and demographical make-up of the wider society. While it is evident in the literature on electoral systems and representation that women are better represented numerically under `pure' PR systems, more recently, countries seeking electoral reform have turned to mixed or hybrid electoral systems. Mixed electoral systems which have become popular over the past few decades are similar to other forms of PR systems in that the overall total of party members in the elected body is intended to mirror the overall proportion of votes received. The difference lies in the way by which they include a set of members elected by geographic constituency and who are deducted from the party totals so as to maintain an overall proportionality. As a proportional representation system, the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) ensures that voters' party preferences are proportionally reflected in the party composition of parliament.},

Turning away from political-economic models that see only domination and resistance, exploiters and victims, the contributors to this pathbreaking collection suggest alternate ways of understanding the role that U.S. actors and agencies have played in the region during the postcolonial period.Exploring a variety of nineteenth- and twentieth-century encounters in Latin America, these theoretically engaged essays by distinguished U.S. and Latin American historians and anthropologists illuminate a wide range of subjects. From the Rockefeller Foundation's public health initiatives in Central America to the visual regimes of film, art, and advertisements; these essays grapple with new ways of conceptualizing public and private spheres of empire. As such,Close Encounters of Empire initiates a dialogue between postcolonial studies and the long-standing scholarship on colonialism and imperialism in the Americas as it rethinks the cultural dimensions of nationalism and development.},

  abstract = {While participatory urban and regional planning have become a widely accepted approach to enhance the democratic aims of community and urban development, challenges still remain. Planners lack the knowledge of usable tools to reach broader groups of participants, which can turn participation into a small-group elitist activity. Also, the quality and utilisation of the knowledge produced is problematic, the collected data remains invisible and systematic analysis is often not realized. In this article, we ask whether digitally supported PPGIS (public participation Geographical Information Systems) tools can help addressing these challenges. Through a critical analysis and reflection upon over 200 real life planning cases in Finland (62\%) and other countries (38\%) using PPGIS methodology we study the ability of PPGIS tools to (1) enhance effective arrangements of public participation, (2) reach a broad spectrum of people and 3) produce high quality and versatile knowledge. Our results indicate a variety of advantages and disadvantages in using PPGIS methodology in urban and regional planning practice. By categorizing the pros and cons of using PPGIS in practise, we enable planners to implement more inclusive and people-centred urban and regional planning in the future.},

With house prices falling, lending standards tightening, unemployment rising, and interest rate resets in the pipeline, foreclosures are projected to go even higher. While most of the time a foreclosure is a suboptimal resolution of a distressed mortgage, a number of features of the mortgage finance system often prevent loan modifications. This paper reviews the impediments to successful mortgage restructuring and proposes a number of ways to improve the situation. The proposals build on the recognition that the key problem is a combination of negative housing equity and unaffordable debt service, and a successful loan modification scheme should address both issues. Given the key role foreclosures play in the adverse housing market dynamics, and several market failures that the paper identifies, the burden of mortgage debt restructuring should be shared by the taxpayer.},

In particular we account for the tremendous influx of immigrants and the changing ethnic compositions of cities, especially the increased share of Hispanics. We use data from the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) to examine urban labor markets in 276 large cities in the United States for four demographic groups: blacks, Hispanics, immigrants and whites. Using data organized by both place of work and place residence at the census tract-level within each metropolitan area, we define spatial mismatch indices in a unique way. We find statistical evidence that blacks experience adverse labor market outcomes in the presence of spatial mismatch while controlling for the presence of immigrants and Hispanics. The magnitude of the marginal effects of the spatial mismatch indices are quantitatively small; however, the aggregate effects of being in one of the six ``gateway'' states\textemdash{}major immigrant destinations in recent years--are quantitatively large. In addition, we find that the other minority study groups, immigrants and Hispanics, also experience adverse labor market outcomes in the presence of the spatial mismatch of jobs and their residences. In contrast, whites' labor market outcomes appear not to be related to spatial mismatch indices. *corresponding author; University of Houston, Department of Economics, 204 McElhinney Hall, Houston, TX 77204-5019, Phone:713-743-3799, Fax:713-743-3798, email: jkohlhase@uh.edu. ** Box 882, Department of Economics, Tung-hai University, 181 Tai-chung Harbor Road, Section 3 Tai-chung 40704 Taiwan, email: jhlin1125@thu.edu.tw.

Results revealed most guardians were aware of youth recreation benefits and particularly valued communal recreation experiences such as interactions with family and friends in outdoor environments. State parks were particularly popular locations for socially oriented recreation, especially for Latino families.

  abstract = {We study several interconnected problems that arise under the current U.S.patent system when a patent covers one component or feature of a complexproduct, This situation is common in the information technology sector ofthe economy. First, we show using bargaining theory that the threat toobtain a permanent injunction greatly enhances the patent holder'snegotiating power, leading to royalty rates that exceed a natural benchmarklevel based on the value of the patented technology and the strength of thepatent. Such royalty overcharges are especially great for weak patentscovering a minor feature of a product with a sizable price/cost margin.These royalty overcharges do not disappear even if the allegedly infringingfirm is fully aware of the patent when it initially designs its product.However, the holdup problems caused by the threat of injunctions arereduced if courts regularly grant stays to permanent injunctions to givedefendants time to redesign their products to avoid infringement when thisis possible. Second, we show how holdup problems are magnified in thepresence of royalty stacking, i.e., when multiple patents read on a singleproduct. Third, using third-generation cellular telephones and Wi-Fi asleading examples, we illustrate that royalty stacking has become a veryserious problem, especially in the standard-setting context where hundredsor even thousands of patents can read on a single product standard. Fourth,we discuss the use of reasonable royalties to award damages in patentinfringement cases. We report empirical results regarding the measurementof reasonable royalties by the courts and identify various practicalproblems that tend to lead courts to over-estimate reasonable royalties inthe presence of royalty stacking. Finally, we make suggestions for patentreform based on our theoretical and empirical findings.},

The long-brewing protest movement officially started with the United People's Front's forty-point set of demands made to the government in February of 1996 and swiftly became an insurgent movement, sweeping the nation into a full-fledged armed conflict. When Nepal's government and the Communist Party of Nepal\textendash{}Maoist (or CPN-M) signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord in November of 2006, more than thirteen thousand people had died, hundreds of disappearances were unsolved, and thousands were displaced from their homes. In my research, I argue that three key processes\textemdash{}militarism/militancy, displacement, and altered gender dynamics\textemdash{}ensued, each affecting the others and opening up moments of empowerment, agency, and transformation alongside periods of violence, chaos, and despair. In this symposium, however, I discuss the centrality of gender and women's gendered bodies to forwarding the People's War by the CPN-M and briefly examine the war's intended and unintended outcomes for women.},

  abstract = {The competitiveness of an individual firm depends upon the competitiveness of the value chain to which it belongs. The core constraint of virtually every chain is that chains are structured, measured and managed in parts, i.e. vertically disintegrated, rather than as a whole. Assessing the performance of vertically disintegrated firms can provide an insight of how each firm acts in such a value chain. This paper aims to study the operating performance of the vertically disintegrated chain in the integrated circuits (IC) industry. A performance evaluation was completed for 48 leading vertically disintegrated semiconductor companies in Taiwan, including 17 in design, 10 in fabrication and 21 in packaging/testing, using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach which inherently recognises tradeoffs among various measures. The empirical results indicate that the IC design firms perform better than IC fabrication and IC packaging/testing firms. Overall, semiconductor firms in Taiwan still have room for performance improvement. In addition, the empirical results suggest that an IC company's scale of size does play an important role in influencing its operating efficiency. One can increase performance by consolidating with other smaller units to achieve an optimal size. In addition, an analysis of operating performance by DEA can provide a semiconductor firms' operations with insights into resource allocation competitive advantages, and help with strategic decision-making, especially regarding operational styles under an intense competitive environment.

  abstract = {Background
Little is known about the food acquisition and shopping habits of residents living in food deserts.
Objective
To identify distinct food acquisition and shopping patterns among residents, most of whom (81\%) live in food desert (low income and low access) census tracts, and characterize these patterns with respect to the residents' socioeconomic status, nutrition knowledge, and perceptions of their food environment.
Design
This is a cross-sectional study.
Participants/setting
Four hundred sixty-six primary food shoppers were included from two counties in South Carolina during 2013-2014.
Main outcome measures
Participants' self-reported food acquisition and shopping habits, including shopping distance; frequency; store type; transportation mode; use of farmers' markets, food banks/pantries, and church/social service organizations, were used to develop shopping patterns and group residents. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation, food security, income, and education, nutrition knowledge, and perceptions of the food environment were used to characterize these groups.
Statistical analyses performed
Latent class analysis and multinomial logistic regression were used to identify and characterize patterns, respectively.
Results
Three patterns were identified, including those who use community food resources, are infrequent grocery shoppers, and use someone else's car or public transportation when shopping (Class 1) (35\%), those who use community food resources and are more frequent and proximal shoppers (Class 2) (41\%), and those who do not use community food resources and are distal shoppers (Class 3) (24\%). Compared with Class 3, Class 1 had comparatively lower socioeconomic status. Class 2 also had comparatively lower socioeconomic attributes except for income. Class 2 was not significantly different from Class 1 except that a higher proportion in Class 1 saw food access as a problem. No significant differences across classes were found regarding fruit and vegetable recommendation knowledge.
Conclusions
Shopping frequency, use of community food resources, transportation methods, and shopping distance were the key factors that defined distinct patterns among residents living in low-income areas. Future interventions to increase healthy food access in underserved areas should not only consider accessibility but also community food resource use.},

Such applications provide a basis for examining the relationship between the use of geo-information and governance, as many P-GIS initiatives claim to foster accountability, transparency, legitimacy and other dimensions of governance. Examples from recent literature illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of utilising P-GIS, and in particular, the implications for greater participation, empowerment, and ownership of and access to spatial information, and for governance in general. Some new developments in GIS technology, like `mobile-GIS', have the potential to strengthen these impacts. While P-GIS is not an essential component of PSP, if used with an adequate regard and sensitivity for issues of ownership, legitimacy and local knowledge, it can contribute to the empowerment of communities in solving spatial planning problems.},

Despite recent nationally traumatic events, including the attacks of September 11th and the war on terrorism, Republicans and Democrats remain deeply divided. Many now refer to these divisions as red state versus blue state politics. Is geography really the source of the contemporary partisan deadlock? If so, what possibility is there for overcoming these divisions on pressing political problems such as the economy and the war in Iraq? In this article, we look at geography and partisanship from an historic perspective. Using multivariate analysis of roll call voting in the House of Representatives from 1889 to 2002, we demonstrate that bipartisanship is most likely when the two political parties are geographically diverse or nationally competitive. This has not been the case in recent years, making bipartisanship harder to come by. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications for future bipartisan unity.},

In this paper, we evaluate the validity and consistency of this conventional wisdom, using both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections results by county. While previous research has underscored the overall pattern and its accuracy, we choose instead to explore mainly the anomalous results: ``metropolitan'' or ``modern'' areas that President Bush carried, and ``nonmetropolitan'' and ``traditional'' areas that Democrats won. We develop a typology of the anomalous counties and carry out a simple analysis of characteristics that help show how and why they are anomalous. We then compare the 2000 and 2004 results to discover anomalous areas, counties which switched parties or which became more or less partisan. Trends between 2000 and 2004 suggest a weakening of the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan dimension but a deepening of the cultural one, although we note as well that most of the electorate does not place itself at these partisan extremes. We relate these findings to longer term structural changes in American society, and to Republican strategies to mobilize insecure voters. Finally, we lay out an agenda to look at a sample of counties, using qualitative methods, in order to understand these anomalous results.},

Although the antitrust laws prohibit firms from restricting competition in labor markets like in product markets, the government does little to address the labor market problem and private litigation has been rare and mostly unsuccessful. The reason is that the analytic methods for evaluating labor market power in antitrust contexts are primitive, far less sophisticated than the legal rules used to judge product market power. To remedy this asymmetry, we propose methods for judging the effects of mergers on labor markets. We also extend our approach to other forms of anticompetitive practices undertaken by employers against workers. We highlight some arguments and evidence indicating that market power may be even more important in labor than in product markets.},

This research, however, tends to focus on one's personal economic situation or national economic conditions, with considerably less scholarly attention directed toward understanding how intermediate levels, such as citizens' local economic environment, shapes mass economic policy preferences. In response, this article develops a theory of the effect of local economic context on policy preferences which posits national economic events as a moderating factor and views toward the fairness of the economic system as an intervening factor. Drawing upon over a decade of survey data, and focusing on the 2008 Financial Crisis and public views toward business corporations, this article demonstrates that the Crisis polarized citizens across affluent and poor areas with respect to perceptions of corporate-led maldistribution, which in turn, had an indirect polarizing effect on economic policy mood.},

  abstract = {The smartphone patent wars sparked a crisis. As global patent litigation accelerated, an arms race characterized by competing alliances and massive portfolio acquisitions ensued. Inevitably, 4G and 3G wireless protocols adopted by standard-setting organizations (SSOs) came under fire. Because UMTS, GSM, LTE, and other specifications are indispensable for mobile devices, standard-essential patents (SEPs) became a central object of procurement and assertion efforts. A recurring claim was hold-up: certain SEP owners, having assured SSOs that they would license their essential technologies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory (RAND) terms, sought to enjoin smartphone makers from practicing industry standards. Charged with protecting consumers, antitrust enforcers experienced pressure to do something. The FTC and other competition agencies responded aggressively, clamping down on perceived efforts by owners of RAND-encumbered SEPs to hold-up standard implementers. They happened upon the rule that such patentees violate antitrust law if they try to enjoin a "willing licensee"-essentially a "no-injunction rule." While that approach has intuitive appeal, it violates core antitrust principles. In America, part of the problem lies in the FTC's reliance on section 5 of the FTC Act to capture conduct that goes beyond the reach of the Sherman Act. The no-injunction rule breezes past the key question, which is whether the pertinent conduct harms competition. Seemingly oblivious to the fact that they challenge behavior outside antitrust's remit, enforcers the world over have made an antitrust problem of acts that do not always-or even generally-damage the competitive process. This Article explains that certain SEP-related conduct assailed by antitrust-enforcement bodies is not a problem born of the competitive process. Rather, it reflects incomplete contracting at the time of standardization, ensuing choices by firms to lock into technologies for which they lack licenses, and harm that can occur only when a court would likely grant the sought-after relief. Absent deception that harms competition in an upstream technology-licensing market, such situations do not involve anticompetitive conduct by an SEP owner. Divorced from such harm, attempted hold-up in breach of a RAND-licensing promise sounds in contract. These considerations require rethinking contemporary enforcement actions in the standard-setting arena. They also call into question how the FTC and other antitrust agencies view the laws that they are responsible for enforcing. Yes, antitrust plays an important economic role, but only in policing market-imposed constraints on conduct. The tortured jurisprudence in the standard-setting field would regain coherence were enforcers to cabin antitrust to its appropriate role. For standards, that means allowing the institutions that society has entrusted to resolve disputes-the courts and International Trade Commission-to do so, and to tackle larger questions of hold-up under the rubric of contract law when harm to competition is absent.

In a global political economy that incites 'competition for jobs', the idea cannot escape controversy. Crucially, it has failed to win significant support from trade unionists in the global South. Drawing on viewpoints voiced by workers' rights activists in South Africa and Brazil, this article presents four propositions on the features and functions that a labour-trade linkage would have to possess if it is to serve workers' interests, and explores whether and how these may be accommodated by the ILO and WTO regimes. It is argued that a linkage requiring a new single WTO undertaking is out of the question; a linkage would only make sense if it superimposes ILO rule onto the WTO, not the opposite; a linkage should be premised on positive trade measures; and, finally, it should serve the interests of presently unprotected and unorganized workers. Overall, the main challenge of such a linkage would be to achieve the necessary reform within the ILO.},

The newest sites, such as Washita Battlefield, tell newer stories that resonate well with today's visitors. These provide a model for revising older sites. Giving greater attention to causes and consequences, aiming for a richer mix of disciplinary perspectives, including a wider range of historic and prehistoric peoples, and providing more balance in cases of war or cultural conflict will all improve interpretation. Exploring multiple meanings of resources such as wilderness will bring the National Park Service's practices closer to modern academic literatures. Engaging both controversial histories and modern controversies over policy constitutes good pedagogy and should also be part of updated interpretative programs.},

Moreover, Django Unchained has become a popular culture phenomenon, with t-shirts, highly contentious action figures, posters, and strong DVD/BluRay sales. The topic (slavery and revenge), the setting (a few years before the Civil War), the intentionally provocative generic roots (Spaghetti Western and Blaxploitation) and the many intertexts and references (to German and French culture) demand a thorough examination.

  abstract = {Over 20 years of scholarship suggests that living in America's poorest and most dangerous communities diminishes the life course development of children and adults. In the 1990s, the dire conditions of some of these neighborhoods, especially those with large public housing developments, prompted significant policy responses. In addition to the demolition and redevelopment of some of the projects, the federal government launched an experiment to help families leave poor neighborhoods through an assisted housing voucher program called Moving to Opportunity (MTO). While families who moved through this program initially relocated to census tracts with poverty rates almost four times lower than their original projects, many returned to communities of moderate to high poverty. Why? We use mixed methods to explore the patterns and the decision-making processes behind moves among MTO families. Focusing on the Baltimore MTO site, we find that traditional theories for residential choice did not fully explain these outcomes. While limited access to public transportation, housing quality problems, and landlords made it hard for families to move to, or stay in, low-poverty neighborhoods, there were also more striking explanations for their residential trajectories. Many families valued the low-poverty neighborhoods they were originally able to access with their vouchers, but when faced with the need to move again, they often sacrificed neighborhood quality for dwelling quality in order to accommodate changing family needs. Having lived in high-poverty neighborhoods most of their lives, they developed a number of coping strategies and beliefs that made them confident they could handle such a consequential trade-off and protect themselves and their children from the dangers of poorer areas.},

  abstract = {For more than thirty years now, thinking about the way we, humans, account for our past has taken place under the aegis of representationalism. In its first two decades, representationalism, inaugurated by Hayden White's Metahistory of 1973, has been remarkably successful, but by now it has lost much of its vigor and it lacks explanatory power when faced with recent phenomena such as memory, lieux de memoire, remembrance, and trauma. It might be argued that many of the shortcomings of representationalism spring from the fact that it is exclusively geared to "transfer of meaning." This essay posits that what may be called "presence" ("the unrepresented way the past is present in the present") is at least as important as "meaning." "Presence" can be dealt with by employing a "topical" view of history (in the manner of, for example, Vico) in which the whole of history is stored in "places" (that is, "institutions") that can be "visited" on the plane of the present. Presence can be said to be stored in metonymy. Whereas metaphor is instrumental in the"transfer of meaning," metonymy brings about a "transfer of presence." A metonymy is a "presence in absence" not just in the sense that it presents something that isn't there, but also in the sense that in the absence (or at least the radical inconspicuousness) that is there, the thing that isn't there is still present. The presence of the past thus does not reside primarily in the intended story or the manifest metaphorical content of the text, but in what story and text contain in spite of the intentions of the historian. One might say that historical reality travels with historiography not as a paying passenger but as a stowaway. As a stowaway, as what is absently and unintentionally present on the plane of time, metonymy is a metaphor for discontinuity, or, rather, for the entwinement of continuity and discontinuity.},

  abstract = {Urban transit systems in most American cities\ldots{}have become a genuine civil rights issue-and a valid one-because the layout of rapid-transit systems determines the accessibility of jobs to the Black community. If transportation systems in American cities could be laid out so as to provide an opportunity for poor people to get meaningful employment, then they could begin to move into the mainstream of American life. A good example of this problem is my home city of Atlanta, where the rapid-transit system has been laid out for the convenience of the white upper-middle-class suburbanites who commute to their jobs downtown. The system has virtually no consideration for connecting the poor people with their jobs. There is only one possible explanation for this situation, and that is the racist blindness of city planners. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1986, pp. 325-326) Much attention is being paid to the role of public transit in employment-related mobility for urban residents, yet there is very little evidence of the degree to which one affects the other. Little research has focused on how labor participation is affected by increases in urban workers' access to public transportation. Research on the spatial mismatch hypothesis has dealt with the relationship between labor participation and the spatial separation of workers' residences from suitable jobs; however, most analyses concentrate on commuting time or distance as a function of auto use. Few studies have considered the impacts of public transportation on labor participation. This article describes a study analyzing the locations and employment characteristics of workers with varying levels of access to public transit. Using census data and a variety of spatial measures generated by a geographic information system (GIS), a two-stage least squares regression was used to estimate the relationship of access to public transit with labor participation levels for Portland, Oregon, and Atlanta, Georgia. The results suggest that access to public transit is a significant factor in determining average rates of labor participation within these two cities.},

What roles do institutional entrepreneurs play in the different stages of evolution of the business model?

In this paper, we trace the origin and evolution of the fabless model through a mixed-method approach, utilizing historic milestones, events, and financial data of publicly-traded semiconductor firms. We have applied theories of institutional entrepreneurship and adaptive ecosystem to identify four stages in this history: differentiation, mobilization, legitimization, and symbiosis to conceptualize the fabless model's co-creation and co-evolution. Our findings indicate that actions of institutional entrepreneurs within specific temporal locations and structures played a crucial role in the fabless business model's origin and co-evolution.},

In Atlanta, Georgia, welfare recipients generally live in neighborhoods that are far removed from the majority of appropriate entry-level jobs. We wanted to help craft a solution to that problem. Our own work evolved through three stages. First we reviewed the research literature on spatial mismatch and the preliminary results of mobility demonstration programs elsewhere. Next we completed a spatial analysis of Atlanta's welfare recipients and entry-level jobs. And finally we designed a detailed list of projects. The final product was a successful proposal for \$2 million in funding from the Jobs Access and Reverse Commute (JA/RC) grant program, authorized under PL 105-178, Section 3037 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).

A balance sheet approach shows that macro regulation linked long duration liabilities in housing finance (mortgages) to long duration assets (pensions).

Around the world, more and more money is being invested in buildings and land. Real estate is now a \$217 trillion dollar industry, worth thirty-six times the value of all the gold ever mined. It forms sixty percent of global assets, and one of the most powerful people in the world-the president of the United States-made his name as a landlord and developer. Samuel Stein shows that this explosive transformation of urban life and politics has been driven not only by the tastes of wealthy newcomers, but by the state-driven process of urban planning. Planning agencies provide a unique window into the ways the state uses and is used by capital, and the means by which urban renovations are translated into rising real estate values and rising rents. Capital City explains the role of planners in the real estate state, as well as the remarkable power of planning to reclaim urban life},

This Article challenges the prevailing view of social capital's salutary effects with a more skeptical account that examines the dark side of residential social capital \textemdash{} its capacity to effectuate local factions and promote restraints and inegalitarianism that close off property.  I introduce a set of claims about social capital's dark side in residential property and explore these points through the examples of local racial purging, land cartels, and residential self-governance.  First, contrary to the assumption of a social capital deficit, residential racial segregation and land cartelization, perhaps the deepest imprints on the American property landscape today, suggest an abundance of local social capital and possible unintended consequences of interventions to build social capital.  Second, ``governing by social capital,'' or relying on social capital for property self-governance, may empower factions, breed conflict, and increase the demand for residential homogeneity as a proxy for cooperation.  In light of the mixed evidence for social capital's benefits and its sizable dark side, the more pressing and productive role for property law is not to promote social capital, but to address its negative spillovers and illiberal effects.},

The focus on protection of the physical home has decreased doctrinal efficiency and coherence and derailed Fourth Amendment residential privacy from the core principle of intimate association. This Article challenges Fourth Amendment housing exceptionalism. Specifically, I critique two hallmarks of housing exceptionalism: first, the extension of protection to residential spaces unlikely to shelter intimate association or implicate other key privacy interests; and second, the prohibition of searches that impinge on core living spaces but do not harm interpersonal and domestic privacy.  Contrary to claims in the case law and commentary, there is little evidence to support the broad territorial conception of privacy inherent to the ``sanctity of the home,'' a vital personhood interest in the physical home, or even uniformly robust subjective privacy expectations in varying residential contexts. Similarly, closer examination of the political and historical rationales for housing exceptionalism reveals a nuanced, and equivocal, view of common justifications for privileging the home. This Article advocates replacing the broad sweep of housing exceptionalism, and its emphasis on the physical home, with a narrower set of residential privacy interests that are more attentive to substantive privacy and intimate association.},

I explore psychological, historical, and economic factors that may underlie the variable citizenship effects from homeownership. Some of these factors elucidate not only why owners and tenants perform similarly in certain citizenship measures but, by the same token, why it is not universally true that fear of increased rents constrains local contribution by tenants. I consider the implications of this analysis for legal theory and note potential applications to housing policy.},

In turn, this unravelling of the gendered subject in Nepal serves to reinforce the premise that the representation of 'the Nepali Woman' as a single over-arching category is a contemporary construction, which has been achieved at the expense of consistently effacing the historically prior multiple and contested ethnic/caste identities taken by thrust upon women in what is now the new Nepal. The 'natural' goal of the women's movement since post-1990 Nepal to achieve a (single) feminist agenda has become part of the problem, as it can only be achieved at the expense of respecting the radical diversity and difference that is covered over by the 'theoretical fiction' of the unified nation of Nepal. The main important players, whether it be the women from mainstream political parties, or the women of the NGO world or the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists), have all contributed to excluding and silencing radical diversity in the name of expediency and elite power brokering. Moreover, it is argued that the contours of this composite discourse continue to be shaped by the international aid industry in Nepal, where 'development' is not merely the epistemic link between Nepal and the 'West', it is also the locus classicus of generic apolitical consciousness-less Nepali woman whose cause is taken up by scholar and activist alike.]},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, the global value chain (GVC) approach, with its associated notions of chain governance and firm upgrading, has proliferated as a mode of analysis and of intervention amongst development institutions. This article examines the adoption and adaptation of GVCs at four multilateral agencies in order to understand the purchase of value chain approaches within the development field. Mixing GVC perspectives with other theoretical influences and applied practices, these institutions deploy value chain frameworks to signal a new generation of policies that promise both to consolidate, and to advance beyond, the market fundamentalism of the Washington Consensus. To achieve this, value chain development frameworks craft interventions directed toward various constellations of firm and non-firm actors as a `third way' between state-minimalist and state-coordinated approaches. The authors identify key adaptations of the GVC framework including an emphasis on value chain governance as an instrument to correct market failure in partnership with state and development agencies, and upgrading as a de facto tool for poverty reduction. They find that efforts are ongoing to construct a `post' to the Washington Consensus and that the global value chain is enabling this process by providing a new language and new object of development intervention: `the chain' and the local\textendash{}global linkages that comprise it.},

However, a sustained and considerable decrease in foreclosures has yet to occur. In fact, the real estate market downfall and resulting mortgage and housing crisis have proven to be wider, deeper, and more serious than first anticipated. Since 2007, millions of homeowners faced, and continue to face, foreclosure proceedings. To provide protections for homeowners, federal and state actors have attempted regulatory and legislative solutions to stem the foreclosure crisis. The attempted regulatory and legislative responses, such as foreclosure moratoria, have failed to pull the real estate housing market out of crisis and provide meaningful relief to homeowners facing foreclosure. Many factors contribute to this failure, but namely, lack of uniform rules and policies among the relevant federal and state agencies for lenders, homeowners, and servicers. This Article contends that with the rate of foreclosures predicted to steadily continue into 2015, the need for standardized intervention remains imperative to sustain the goal of homeownership, safeguard consumers, guide lenders/servicers, and stabilize the real estate market.},

  abstract = {Since the 1970s, market restructuring has shifted many workers into workplaces heavily reliant on sales to outside corporate buyers. These outside buyers wield substantial power over working conditions among their suppliers. During the same period, wage growth for middle-income workers stagnated. By extending organizational theories of wage-setting to incorporate interactions between organizations, I predict that wage stagnation resulted in part from production workers' heightened exposure to buyer power. Panel data on publicly traded companies shows that dependence on large buyers lowers suppliers' wages and accounts for 10 percent of wage stagnation in nonfinancial firms since the 1970s. These results are robust to a series of supplementary measures of buyer power; instrumental variable analysis using mergers between buyers; corrections for selection and missing data; and controls for individual worker characteristics like education and occupation. The results show how product market restructuring and new forms of economic segmentation affect workers' wages. The spread of unequal bargaining relations between corporate buyers and their suppliers has slowed wage growth for workers.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the potential demand for public transit for commuting trips \textendash{} a rarely explored perspective for the study of public transit systems. Potential demand for public transit refers to the kind of demand that is not explicitly expressed or realized but will be present if condition permits (i.e. when public transit facility is accessible). In this study, potential demand is surrogated by the proportion of people who may potentially use public transit as primary transportation mode, once public the transit facility becomes available and accessible to these people. A Need Index is introduced to measure the relative magnitude of potential demand. Multiple regression is employed to identify predictive variables for the share of public transportation for work trips. Given the predictive variables, two independent methods are developed to examine potential demands across the space. One method is the abovementioned Need Index method and the other is a data mining approach. The Need Index is mathematically modeled which computes a numeric measure for each spatial unit. The second method uses self-organizing maps (SOM) to find clusters in the high-dimensional vector space of the predictive variables. The study then presents a cross-examination analysis between the results from two methods. An empirical study of Atlanta, Georgia is carried out. In the case study, The United States Census Transportation Planning Package 2000 data at the traffic analysis zones (TAZ) level are used. Existing transit network data are prepared and preprocessed in GIS for spatial analysis. The results of both methods are compared and displayed in GIS for visual examination of spatial distribution of the potential demands. A critique on the comparison of advantages and shortcomings between both methods is provided. It shows that the need index is superior due to its simplicity and its higher level of measurement of potential demands.},
