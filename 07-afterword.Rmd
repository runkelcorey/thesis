This thesis marked the end of a procrastinating, ne'er-do-well, academic career.
Its coming-to-be is the result of many people beside myself.
Herman Mark Schwartz---whom I approached in the summer of 2018 while confusing all sorts of ideas---showed me that these thoughts all had their own places in politics and sociology departments.
As I changed interests every week, it is some irony that his works wound up as the backbone of this thesis.
Claire Szipszky endured many a boring weekend night as I toiled away.
Knowing how much this project meant to me, she provided valuable feedback despite a long history of *me* brusquely editing *her* writing.
Turns out you were the better writer.
My classmates provided encouragement and copy edits in the weeks before our last semester together came to an unexpected, while Michael J. Smith batted cleanup to Alena Titova's immortal writing advice.
William Lawson at the FHFA was quick to help with the particulars of the FHFA's home price indices, and Jon Kropko helped me avoid triple interaction effects.
Finally, none of this would have been possible without my own hidden welfare state administered by Christopher and Elaine Runkel.
To all of you, thank you.
