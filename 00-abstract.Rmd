The mortgage crisis of 2007--2012 saw the foreclosure of more than 10 million Americans.
In response, the federal government authorized three rounds of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), a relief effort aimed at stabilizing prices.
Though this program resembled Democrat-supported welfare programs, there are theoretical questions about the impacts it may have had on voting by raising prices.
Political economists have predicted that increased home equity leads to preferences for less social insurance.
This research would suggest that the Neighborhood Stabilization Program pushed voters towards Republican candidates, especially towards self-avowed members of the Tea Party Caucus, which sharpened the taxation--social insurance connection and derided the subsidy of home mortgages.
Disambiguating these forces---one social, the other financial---is the object of this thesis.

In Chapter \@ref(actors-motive), I examine why federal relief was needed in the first place by breaking down other possible actors into three categories.
For homeowners, the geography of the crisis and recent history of homeownership diffused activism aimed at local and federal office-holders.
Local office-holders, closer to those homeowners, were anyways ill-equipped to handle the crisis due to the long 20th-century shift of responsibilities to the federal government.
Creditors, if they wanted to take action, were thwarted by the oragnization of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

In Chapter \@ref(motive-opportunity), I try to understand how the NSP fit with US politics.
I find that, rather than sitting in a party, homeownership programs such as the NSP rested in the executive branch.
I then chart the growth of homeownership, its underlying policies, and the simultaneous rise of a fervent anti-tax rhetoric on the right, concluding with the creation of the Tea Party, that made increasing home prices and decreasing welfare legible as Republican issues.

Then, in Chapter \@ref(methods), I set out to model this behavior.
I consider the political economy literature surrounding housing and political behavior to develop a theoretical relaltionship between Republican voting share and proxies for home equity.
This model is then tested in Chapter \@ref(outcome).
With a novel dataset connecting NSP target areas, 2010 midterm vote returns, home prices, and a range of demographic information, I find evidence that the behavior theorized *did* occur, but that the behavior may have been limited to races where a self-described member of the Tea Party did *not* run.
Chapter \@ref(conclusion) summarizes these findings, and offers some indication of where debt politics and offshoots of the Great Recession may be headed for greater visibility.
