# thesis
This repository will store all the writing, code, and references for my undergraduate thesis in Political & Social Thought. I'm writing longform with GitHub and Yihui Xie's [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) for the first time for three aims. First, I need to back-up everything. Work built from source will stand up to the most egregious crash, hack, or loss. Second, I am both an open-source and publishing nerd. I am thrilled to see how working from source facilitates interoperability, quick drastic design changes, and the magic that happens when you finally get to preview work. Finally, I hope this repository will help someone shopping around for workflow examples, software tips, or plain-old ideas about foreclosure and American responses.

## workflow
I work chapter by chapter, so needs may change, but my preliminary file structure is this:

* `raw` holds all the data stored on my computer, along with its own README for when such things get lost
* `intermediate` contains cleaned files and the scripts that generated them
* `final` tracks the various uses for the cleaned files; several will flow to more than one end use
* `ref` stores all my references, from Zotero via Better BibTex
* `writing` is fairly self-evident
* `static` sees all the files I need for publication, but don't fit elsewhere---PNGs, fonts, etc.
